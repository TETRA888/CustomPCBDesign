# `Simple guideline for myself when designing Altium Projects:`

- Throughly research the circuit and how it functions
- Draw out a simple circuit on a piece of paper or in Altium
- Read up on part documentation
- Create custom symbol or download and import part data from digikey
- Check for part availability on LCSC and add part parameter to the custom/imported circuit part
- Add description and comments

# `After completing Altium Schematic`
- Begin importing PCB libararies for the part footprints
